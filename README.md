# Weather_App

Build a weather application that fetches weather data from an API asynchronously and displays it to the user. The application should have the following features:

1. A form where the user can input a city or zip code to get the weather for that location.
2. Use the Fetch API or AJAX calls to fetch the weather data asynchronously from a weather API.
3. Display the weather information on the screen, including the temperature, conditions, and any other relevant data.
4. Handle errors gracefully, such as when the user enters an invalid location or there is an issue with the API call.
5. Implement a loading indicator to let the user know when the data is being fetched.
6. For an additional challenge, you could also include a feature to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit units for the temperature display.
